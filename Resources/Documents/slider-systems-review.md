## Shared Component

### Floor Guide (used by all three systems)
| Code | Description | Width (mm) | Height (mm) | Length (mm) | Depth (mm) |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| SL-0099P | Floor Guide | 30 | 23 | 50 | 19 |

---

## Notes

1. All three systems use the **SL-0099P Floor Guide** as a shared component
2. Track lengths are **2000mm stock** — cut to size on site
3. The Duplo system is fundamentally different (twin tubes) vs Edge/City (rectangular tracks)
4. City Slider's `CSLF-2000B` fixed adapter is unique — no equivalent in Edge or Duplo
5. Many drawing dimensions have low OCR confidence due to annotation text extraction
